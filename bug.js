In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error arises when a component within the item rendering function attempts to access state or props before they've fully mounted or updated. This often leads to undefined values being used, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.  The timing of data fetching or asynchronous operations can exacerbate this issue.
